# Design Document

## Overview

The Hub header enhancement will add a consistent, professional header to the Hub page that matches the design patterns established in other views like DashboardHeaderView. The header will be simple and focused, containing just the page title while maintaining visual consistency with the rest of the app.

## Architecture

The header will be implemented as a separate computed property within the existing HubView struct, following the same pattern used in other views. This approach maintains code organization and makes the header easily maintainable.

### Component Structure
```
HubView
├── headerView (new computed property)
├── tabSelectorSection (existing)
├── overviewCardsSection (existing)
└── other existing sections...
```

## Components and Interfaces

### Header Component Design

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Main title: "Hub" 
- Font: System font, size 24, weight .bold
- Color: Primary text color (#1A1A1A)
- Background: White with subtle shadow

**Layout Structure:**
```swift
HStack {
    Text("Hub")
        .font(.system(size: 24, weight: .bold))
        .foregroundColor(Color(hex: "#1A1A1A"))
    
    Spacer()
    
    // Future: Optional action buttons can be added here
}
.padding(.horizontal, 16)
.padding(.vertical, 16)
.background(Color.white)
.shadow(color: Color.black.opacity(0.05), radius: 2, x: 0, y: 1)
```

### Integration Points

**Existing Code Modification:**
- Add `headerView` computed property to HubView
- Insert header into the main VStack before `tabSelectorSection`
- Maintain existing spacing and layout patterns

**Consistency with Existing Headers:**
- Follow the same styling as `DashboardHeaderView`
- Use identical padding, colors, and shadow properties
- Maintain the same visual weight and hierarchy

## Data Models

No new data models are required for this enhancement. The header will be purely presentational and use existing app styling constants.

## Error Handling

No specific error handling is required as this is a static UI component. The header will always display the fixed title "Hub".

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Testing
1. **Cross-device Testing:** Verify header displays correctly on different iPhone sizes
2. **Consistency Testing:** Compare with Dashboard and Schedule headers for visual alignment
3. **Scroll Testing:** Ensure header remains properly positioned during content scrolling

### Integration Testing
1. **Tab Navigation:** Verify header appears correctly when switching to Hub tab
2. **Content Layout:** Ensure existing content is not negatively affected by header addition
3. **Performance:** Confirm no performance impact from header addition

### Accessibility Testing
1. **VoiceOver:** Ensure header title is properly announced
2. **Dynamic Type:** Verify header scales appropriately with system font sizes
3. **Contrast:** Confirm text meets accessibility contrast requirements

## Implementation Notes

### Styling Constants
The header will use existing app color constants:
- `textColor = Color(hex: "#1A1A1A")` for the title
- `Color.white` for background
- Standard shadow with `Color.black.opacity(0.05)`

### Layout Considerations
- Header will be positioned at the top of the ScrollView content
- Existing `tabSelectorSection` will move down to accommodate header
- No changes needed to existing spacing between other sections

### Future Extensibility
The header design allows for future enhancements such as:
- Action buttons (settings, notifications)
- Subtitle or additional context
- Search functionality
- Period selector (similar to other views)

The simple initial implementation provides a foundation for these potential additions while meeting current requirements.
