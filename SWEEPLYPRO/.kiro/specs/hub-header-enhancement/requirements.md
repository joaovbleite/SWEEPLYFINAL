# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a header section to the Hub page in SWEEPLYPRO to improve navigation and provide better visual hierarchy. The header will include the page title and maintain consistency with other views in the app like the Dashboard and Schedule views.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner using the Hub page, I want to see a clear page title at the top, so that I know which section of the app I'm currently viewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the Hub tab THEN the system SHALL display "Hub" as the main title at the top of the page
2. WHEN the user scrolls through the Hub content THEN the header SHALL remain visible and fixed at the top
3. WHEN the header is displayed THEN it SHALL use consistent styling with other app headers (font size, weight, color)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating between different tabs, I want consistent header styling across all main views, so that the app feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Hub header is displayed THEN it SHALL match the visual style of the Dashboard header
2. WHEN the header is rendered THEN it SHALL use the app's primary text color (#1A1A1A)
3. WHEN the header is positioned THEN it SHALL have appropriate padding and spacing consistent with other views

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on the Hub page, I want the header to be visually separated from the content below, so that I can easily distinguish between the navigation area and the main content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the header is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a subtle shadow or border to separate it from the content
2. WHEN the header background is rendered THEN it SHALL use the app's standard background color (#F5F5F5 or white)
3. WHEN content scrolls beneath the header THEN the visual separation SHALL remain clear and readable
